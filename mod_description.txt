I was not happy with arrangement of the display, so I created my own version.

main display (always):
- current gear
- current speed
- cruise control
- compass

main display 1:
- average (trip) consumption
- instant consumption

main display 2:
- remaining fuel
- guessed operating range

main display 3:
- water temperature
- oil temperature

main display 4:
-  ambient temperature

rpm display:
- time
- engine running time

speed display:
- odometer
- trip distance
